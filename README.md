# APS502-Financial-Engineering
## Description
Course project of APS502 (Winter 2020) at the University of Toronto. 

Calculated expected returns, standard deviations and co-variances between 8 assets. 

Used the mean-variance optimization model to generate an efficient frontier of the assets, also got the optimal weights of the assets.

## Note
All csv files are in Data folder, they were downloaded from Yahoo finance.

xxx_next.csv is just a month later's data of xxx.csv. One csv file for one asset is actually enough.

Calculations of expected returns, standard deviations and co-variances were done in matlab.
